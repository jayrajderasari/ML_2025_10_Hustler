1. Tasks completed during the week

Objective:
Our objective for this week concentrated on extracting proper features from images for implementation in a Person Re-identification model. The method enables improved picture-based individual description and comparison for visual features.

Fourier Transform Features:

The research used 2D Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze frequency domain features in the images.

Extracted 3 main features:
FFT Mean: Average value of the magnitude spectrum.
FFT Variance: Variability in the frequency domain.
FFT Energy: Total energy of the image in the frequency domain.

Wavelet Transform Features:

Used a 2D Haar Wavelet Transform to decompose the image into four sub-bands.

For each sub-band, extracted:

Mean: Average pixel value.
Variance: Variation of pixel values.
Energy: Sum of squared pixel values.

cA_mean, cA_variance, cA_energy, cH_mean, cH_variance, cH_energy, cV_mean, cV_variance, cV_energy, cD_mean, cD_variance, cD_energy

cA(Wavelet Approximation)
cH(Horizontal Detail)
cV(Vertical Detail)
cD(Diagonal Detail)

Data Storage and Organization:

Collected features for each person and image in a structured format.
Data was organized into two separate tables for Fourier and Wavelet features.
Saved the extracted features to an Excel file for further analysis and model training.

2. Tasks planned for the coming week

The plan for the next week is to analyse the pre-processed data and understand implication and implementation of existing state of art models.
