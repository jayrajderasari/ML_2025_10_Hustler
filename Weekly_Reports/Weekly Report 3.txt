Tasks Completed This Week:

The team dedicated this week to reorganize past work structures so we could implement stable strategies during following project stages. A review of our dataset preprocessing techniques included validation of data cleaning methods together with verification of selected features that match our project objectives. The team enhanced their exploratory data analysis efficiency through complete analysis of essential patterns and correlation presence and potential outlier behavior to improve feature engineering practices.

Analysis of machine learning algorithms for our dataset included theoretical assessment along with potential applications testing to build up our model development strategy. Our approach was tested against existing methodologies through research of past studies and documents in the literature. The code base received architectural improvements supported by documentation making it easier for future team members to understand and enhance experimental operations.


Tasks Planned for Next Week:

The upcoming week will bring an implementation phase of hyperparameter tuning methods for our models while evaluating them through suitable assessment metrics. The team will investigate various feature transformation methods that might enhance accuracy outcomes for our models. We will investigate substitute models when our initial models fail to reach adequate outcomes. We will work on streamlining computational efficiency for training purposes while we conduct our analysis.
