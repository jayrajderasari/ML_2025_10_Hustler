Weekly Report:

1.Tasks completed during the week:

We added the Mean Average Precision (mAP) evaluation metric to our person re-identification model evaluation process during this week while keeping the CMC curves. The evaluation system enabled precise measurement of both precision and recall to obtain a thorough assessment of model retrieval outcomes.

The team investigated different optimization strategies which included strategies to weight features and reduce dimensions in order to determine which discriminatory features lead to improved ranking results. The model managed to achieve better performance together with reduced computational requirements through this enhancement.

We performed a study to validate the model's parameters which determined both similarity assessment and ranking operations. Multiple experimental settings were established to find the best combination of elements for achieving maximum precision within the re-identification process.

Our research strategy delivered better insights into how feature selection with similarity measures relate to retrieval quality while establishing essential knowledge for concluding improvements.

2.Tasks planned for the coming week:

Our main priority for the upcoming week revolves around choosing the best feature mixtures and parameter values obtained from our extensive experimental research. We need to finalize our optimal setting of the person re-identification model through these findings to achieve maximum accuracy and operational efficiency. The model generalization abilities become assessable through testing strategy execution which involves running detailed assessments across different datasets in diverse operational conditions. The validation of our approach depends on this step because it demonstrates our approach's ability to scale beyond training data parameters.

The clarity of our results will improve thanks to our effort in developing visualizations which show mAP performance across different feature extraction methods. Our visual components play two roles by advancing findings from our report toward the ultimate presentation. We begin documentation of the final project report where we explain methods and experimental setups together with observed results as well as challenges encountered and project insights. Our team will now organize our presentation material to convey our findings relating to technical complexity and real-life adoption potential of our solution.
