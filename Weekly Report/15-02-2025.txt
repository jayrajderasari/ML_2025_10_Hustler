1. Work Completed (Past Week)

Over the past week, we focused on gaining a deeper understanding of the core concepts of person re-identification. We carefully studied the research paper "Person Re-Identification in the Wild," which provided insights into state-of-the-art techniques, datasets, and challenges associated with the task. Additionally, we reviewed relevant literature on person re-identification to explore various methodologies, feature extraction techniques, and machine learning models that have been successfully implemented in previous works. This review allowed us to identify strengths and weaknesses in existing approaches, helping us formulate potential strategies for our project.

Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the given problem statement to break it down into key challenges and objectives. Understanding these challenges is crucial for designing an effective solution. We also examined different datasets used in past research to assess their applicability to our work. This foundational research phase was instrumental in ensuring that we build a solid framework for further exploration and experimentation in the upcoming weeks.

2. Work Planned (Next Week)

For the coming week, we plan to build upon our foundational research by discussing and finalizing the machine learning techniques most suitable for our problem statement. This will involve brainstorming potential approaches, including deep learning-based solutions and traditional feature-engineering methods, to determine the best-fit model. By evaluating different algorithms and frameworks, we aim to select the most effective methodologies for our project.

Additionally, we will identify and shortlist datasets that can be used for training and evaluation. We will assess the quality, size, and diversity of these datasets to ensure they meet our projectâ€™s requirements. Dataset preprocessing is another key focus area, as we plan to explore techniques such as normalization, augmentation, and data cleaning to enhance model performance.

To streamline our workflow, we will define clear roles and assign tasks within the team to ensure an efficient division of labor. We will also establish evaluation metrics that will help us measure model effectiveness as we move forward. These efforts will pave the way for implementing our initial experiments and further refining our approach based on preliminary results.
